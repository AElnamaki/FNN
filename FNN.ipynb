    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "The **Fibonacci sequence** is a well-known numerical sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_0 = 0, \\quad F_1 = 1, \\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence appears in natural phenomena (e.g., phyllotaxis in plants, spiral shells, branching structures) and has inspired computational models due to its **scale-invariant growth** and **self-similar structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we leverage Fibonacci numbers to define **graph connectivity**:\n",
    "- Each node represents a term in the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "- Each new node connects to **its two immediate predecessors** in the sequence.\n",
    "- This forms a **non-uniform, hierarchically connected network** that can be used as:\n",
    "  - A **neural network architecture template** with irregular layer sizes.\n",
    "  - A **graph-structured dataset** for message-passing neural networks (MPNNs).\n",
    "  - A **biologically inspired topology** for information propagation.\n",

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "1. **Graph Initialization**  \n",
    "   We start with two nodes ($0$ and $1$) connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fibonacci Node Generation**  \n",
    "   For each subsequent step, we:\n",
    "   - Compute the next Fibonacci number.\n",
    "   - Add it as a new node to the graph.\n",
    "   - Connect it to the previous two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Visualization**  \n",
    "   The `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries are used to:\n",
    "   - Display the graph structure.\n",
    "   - Show how connections grow following Fibonacci rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output (Depth = 15)\n",
    "For a depth of $15$:\n",
    "- The node labels correspond to Fibonacci numbers up to $F_{14}$.\n",
    "- The graph shows **clustered hubs** (small numbers appear often as predecessors).\n",
    "- Connections naturally form **shortcuts** that can reduce path length, potentially affecting signal propagation efficiency.\n",

    "**Applications in AI**:\n",
    "- **Custom RNN/Graph Neural Network architectures** inspired by natural growth patterns.\n",
    "- **Sparse connectivity models** that reduce computational complexity.\n",
    "- **Biologically motivated design** for neuromorphic computing.\n",
